# Makerobos

A simple aplication built using angular that executes a get request and a post request and populates the results into a table.

This was done using a very basic implementation by subscribing to observables and the whole thing was created using one component only, do take a look, due to time concerns I have kept the CSS as simple as possible. Do take a look and let me know if you need me to make more changes. Thankyou so much for your patience.
